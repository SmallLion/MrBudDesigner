### 👋 Hello, World! I'm Mr. Bud, a Game developer + a designer 🎮
It's kinda hard to tell what is my exact role because, it's a non-static variable. So sometimes I'm a game devloper, a game designer, or maybe a UI designer. 

Oh by the way, just need to warn you about me. If you ever colloborate with me, kindly keep in mind that I messs up in little things, but I do big things nicely. I'm not sure why is that, maybe god did something wrong when building me. 

I have a blog where I share my knowledge with beginners with tutorials of Unity and Python, but I write about other things too! This is my **advice** to stay-up-to date with it or a bug may come and eat you tonight.

 Just kidding, but... it could happen, right? All of us are afraid of Buggy bugs 🐛
